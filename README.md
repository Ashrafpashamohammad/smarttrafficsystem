# 🚦 Smart Traffic Management System – AI-Powered Traffic Control

An intelligent, ML-powered traffic control system that dynamically manages traffic signals based on lane density, detects emergency vehicles, identifies violations, and supports automated response — all from video footage.


----------------------------------------

🚀 About The Project

The Smart Traffic Management System is built to improve urban traffic flow using real-time video analytics. Traditional static timers are inefficient for today’s dynamic traffic conditions. This project combines YOLOv5 object detection, OpenCV, and custom logic to detect vehicle density and automate traffic light durations accordingly.

Additional features include:
- Emergency vehicle detection (ambulance/fire engine)
- Automated challan generation for traffic violations
- Accident detection with automatic ambulance dispatch
- Crime vehicle detection (hit-and-run, chain snatching)

The system is ideal for smart cities aiming to reduce congestion, prioritize emergency response, and enforce road safety.

✨ Features

- 📹 Traffic Density Estimation – Detects vehicle count from junction-side video feeds using YOLOv5  
- 🚨 Emergency Vehicle Detection – Prioritizes ambulances/fire engines stuck in traffic with automatic green signals  
- 📛 Violation Detection – Automatically flags red-light jumping or lane-crossing from CCTV footage  
- ⚠️ Accident Detection – Triggers ambulance dispatch via alert logic upon impact detection  
- 🚓 Crime Vehicle Identification – Detects vehicles involved in criminal activity via license plate verification  
- 📈 Smart Signal Timer – Dynamically allocates green/red time per lane based on live traffic data  
- 🌐 Web UI – Upload 4 video feeds from each direction and receive signal timing + detection results
